# MereldeLeur-NaSch-and-NaSch-IDM-Traffic-Flow-Simulations
This code simulates traffic using the NaSch and NaSch+IDM models on a circular road. Vehicles follow simple acceleration, braking, and movement rules. The IDM extension adds heterogeneous driver behavior. Outputs include speed, flow, loop times, and delays across densities. Results reveal critical dynamics and delay patterns.
